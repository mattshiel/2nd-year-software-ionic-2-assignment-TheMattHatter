## Rick and Morty Essentials

**Rick and Morty Essentials** is a fan app based on the popular TV show "Rick and Morty". It contains a locally stored soundboard and locally stored quiz. This app was created for my second year Mobile Applications Development Assignment which was to develop a mobile application using the Ionic 2 Framework. Aside from that, this app is purely for entertainment purposes and I hope you enjoy using it!
